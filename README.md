The Weather Forecast Application is a full-stack web application designed to provide accurate and real-time weather information for any location. The front-end is developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to deliver a responsive and user-friendly interface. The back-end integrates Java Servlet technology for managing server-side operations and API requests, enabling efficient communication with a Weather API to fetch and display live weather data. This project highlights a seamless blend of modern front-end design and robust back-end functionality.
